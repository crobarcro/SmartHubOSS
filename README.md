# SmartHub
## A fully transparent, bidirectional Analog-Digital Bluetooth Bridge for Siemens/BONUS wind turbines
### Developed for all AN-BONUS (Siemens) 1.3MW and 2MW WTC2 wind turbines, easily adaptable to others

## Description:

- stable and (in the case of our old turbines) more reliable Bluetooth connection;
- translate all signals to digital, transmit and then recreate them on the other side;
- watch every single signal and log all errors on a SD card;
- even more precise than the original transmission;
- a very extensible software, allowing to watch for much more complicated conditions;
- enormously reducing the costs of repairing a slippery ring;
- enormously reduction in time when searching for a problem's cause;
- the error log can be read directly from the SD, or through an Android app.
